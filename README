Description:
Nonagon is a geometric 2D shoot 'em up. The enemies are regular polygons, with the dreaded Nonagon as their dictator. The player strives to destroy these polygons, but the task requires some geometric trickery.

The player has two kinds of guns: transformation and damage. The transformation gun is used to change the orientation of enemy polygons, and the damage gun is used to destroy them.

The enemy polygons are oriented so that a single vertex is facing the player. Each polygon has a "killing vertex", and an enemy polygon can only be damaged when this killing vertex is facing the player. The player uses his transformation gun to bring the killing vertex to the front.

To make this task more challenging, if a player uses the same transformation on the same enemy twice in a row, the enemy activates becomes untransformable for a short time.

When an enemy's kill vertex is facing the player, a shot by the damage gun will kill the enemy.

The enemy polygons fire volleys of bullets at the player. If the player is hit, they lose a life.

If the player kills nine polygons without hitting any twice in a row with the same transformation, they gain nine lives.

The player wins the game by defeating all enemy polygons, including the sinister Nonagon. The player loses when they run out of lives.

Nonagon was created during the April 2011 Pyweek competition. The theme chosen for this competition is "Nine Times".
