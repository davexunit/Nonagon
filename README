Description: (Work in progess)

Nonagon is a geometric 2D side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The enemies are regular polygons, with the dreaded Nonagon as their dictator.

The player's ammunition comes in the form of symmetric transformations on regular polygons. A randomly-generated queue of such transformations is visible at the bottom of the game screen. When the player presses the fire button, the first transformation in the queue is removed, and a projectile is fired. If this projectile hits an enemy polygon, the aforementioned transformation is applied to it. The player defeats enemy polygons by transforming them into specific orientations.

The enemy polygons fire projectiles at the player. If these projectiles hit the player, or if the player collides with an enemy polygon, he or she loses a life.

The player wins the game by defeating all enemy polygons. The player loses when he or she runs out of lives.

Nonagon was created during the April 2011 Pyweek competition. The theme chosen for this competition is "Nine Times".
