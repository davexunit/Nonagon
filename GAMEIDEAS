ENEMY DESIGN
------------
Enemies are regular polygons, ranging in size from 3-gon to 9-gon. These polygons are oriented so that a single vertex is facing downward (toward the player), called the downward vertex. One of the polygon's vertices is assigned as the killing vertex, graphically denoted in some fashion.


TRANSFORMATION GUN
------------------
The transformation gun can fire four different types of transformations. When an enemy is hit by a shot from the transformation gun, the associated transformation is performed on the enemy. The four transformations to an enemy n-gon are:

1. Rotate counter-clockwise 360/n degrees
2. Rotate clockwise 360/n degrees
3. Flip about the line of symmetry that passes through the n-gon's side directly to the left of the downward vertex.
4. Flip about the line of symmetry that passes trhough the n-gon's side directly to the right of the downward vertex.

The transformation gun has a limitation in that it cannot fire the same transformation twice in a row.

DAMAGE GUN
----------
When the player hits an enemy with the vertex gun, one of two possible events occur:
1. SUCCESS: If the enemy's killing vertex is the downward vertex, then the enemy is destroyed.
2. FAILURE: If the enemy's killing vertex is NOT the downward vertex, then the enemy fires several additional bullets at the opponent.

SCORE MULTIPLIER (-- Work in progress --)
----------------
The score multiplier increases the player's points potential, and it also provides the player a means of acquiring a special attack.

At the beginning of the game, the score multiplier begins at its default setting of x1. For every consecutive successful hit with the damage gun, the player's score multiplier is incremented by 1. Whenever a failure hit with the damage gun occurs, the score multiplier is reset to 1.

The score multiplier has a maximum value of x9. When this value is reached, the player unlocks a special attack. (-- describe this special attack here --)

SCORING
-------
When a player destroys an n-gon, the points are awarded using the following equation:
points = (score multiplier)*n*(n - (# of transformations fired at n-gon))

LEVEL LAYOUT (-- Work in progress --)
------------
Enemies spawn on the screen in groups, called waves. Once the current wave is defeated, the next wave spawns. Once all of the waves have been defeated, the level is complete. There are 9 levels in total.

(-- Example level layouts follow --)
