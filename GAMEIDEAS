KILLING ENEMIES
---------------

Option 1: Apply transformations to the enemy polygons so that they all of the same vertex assignment.

Example:

2 --- 3  3 --- 2            2 --- 3 2 --- 3             
 \   /    \   /     =>       \   /   \   /     These triangles match, and
   1        1                  1       1       thus they die.

Pros:
* Simple in concept

Cons:
* Potentially tedious
* Becomes complicated when there are several polygons on the screen
* Difficult with n-gons where n > 4

Option 2: Apply transformations to the enemy polygons so that a certain vertex faces you, called the "killing vertex." There will be some in-game mechanic that allows you to adjust the killing vertex

Example: The killing vertex is #3

   3                      1
 /   \                  /   \
2     4        =>      4     2              Vertex #3 faces you, and
 \   /                  \   /               thus the square dies

Pros:
* Killing method is independent of other polygons
* Simple to analyze
* Extends well to larger polygons

Cons:
* Killing vertex could be a fiddly concept
